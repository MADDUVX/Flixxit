## Important Notes

- At the time of Logging or Registering using vercel deployement link, click the SignIn and Finish button two times, as the connection for mongoDB atlas instance takes 10-30 sec which gives 504 error at first click. So please click the button SignIn/Finish two times 

- Admin dahsboard is only available to admins so normal users cannnot access it. To access admin dashboard use following temporary credentials to login

```bash
Email : adminuser@gmail.com
password: Adminuser!123
```
- Please don't delete data related to movies,series and users from admin dashboard

- The movies and series that are shown in StreamIt are fetched from author's cloud database. So inorder to run this project locally, one needs to follow below points:

```bash
1.Enter u'r own MONGODB atlas database url and a random secret key for jwt sign and verification of accesstoken
2.Use the end point /auth/register to register as admin so u can acess admin dashboard
3. As mentioned above stremit uses mongo database data to fetch data, so one should add their own movies, series list either by using admin dashboard or using api's present in movies route

```

- Some of the features of StreamIt are still under development, so you cannnot use those features.
```bash
Examples:
1. Acessing profile and Settings options on homepage
2. Search bar for searching movies or series
3. Updating user, movies, series data using admin dashboard
